This is a game made for the MSU Game Design Game Jam. 
The theme for this game was "change." I have incorporated it by the main gameplay mechanic being that the enemies change their movement drastically frequently. 


This game is inspired by asteroids, with the same control scheme and screen looping mechanics.

Story:
The year is 2250, and you are the captain of the spacecraft Mantis. You are on a mission to explore a remote part of the galaxy when you suddenly find yourself in the middle of an intense battle with an alien race.

Your ship is equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and shields, but you soon discover that the aliens are constantly evolving and changing their tactics to outsmart you. To survive and complete your mission, you must adapt quickly and become a master of combat in this dangerous new environment.




Power Ups:

As you fight your way through the alien forces, you'll notice that they drop power-ups when defeated. The power-ups come in two types: red and green.

The red power-up will increase your fire rate, allowing you to shoot faster and take down enemies more quickly.

The green power-up will increase your ship's speed, making it easier to evade enemy attacks and outmaneuver them in battle.




Controls:

To control your ship, you can use the following keys:

Press W or the up arrow to activate your boosters and accelerate your ship.

Press A or the left arrow to turn your ship left.

Press D or the right arrow to turn your ship right.

Press Space or the left mouse button to shoot.

CONTROLLER COMPATIBLE (I think)

Use these controls to navigate through the battlefield and take down the alien forces. Good luck, captain!
